# Real-Time Web

This is my repo for the first week of the Real-Time Web course.

Check out the [demo](https://chatting-it-up.herokuapp.com/)

# What is this project about?

In the upcoming three weeks I'm going to learn how to work with real-time data.

# What do you want to accomplish this week?

Setting up a basic chat application according to the Socket.io guide.

People can...

- ...connect to the application
- ...send messages to each other
- ...receive them in real-time

and on top of that I will be adding one extra feature.

# What do you want to accomplish the upcoming weeks?

While experimenting with real-time technologies I wanted to make an application by using the Flickr GraphQL API to also learn how GraphQL works. However, I'm curious to try something different if I can find something cool.
